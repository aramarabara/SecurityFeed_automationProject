For contact information, see https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us/ for Hitachi Energy contact-centers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>General Mitigation Factors</h2>\n<p>Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.</p>\n<p>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.</p>\n<p>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Advisory Conversion Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This ICSA is a verbatim republication of Hitachi Energy PSIRT 8DBD000231 from a direct conversion of the vendor's Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) advisory.

Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.</p>\n<p>Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<p>No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Revision History</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Release Date: </strong>2025-01-06</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\" data-tablesaw-mode=\"stack\" data-tablesaw-minimap=\"\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th role=\"columnheader\" data-tablesaw-priority=\"persist\">Date</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">Revision</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">Summary</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2026-01-06</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Initial Publication</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n",
