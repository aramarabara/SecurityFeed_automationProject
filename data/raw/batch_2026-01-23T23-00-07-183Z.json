    "content": "<h2><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>In response to the June 6, 2025, Executive Order (EO) 14306, “Sustaining Select Efforts to Strengthen the Nation’s Cybersecurity and Amending Executive Order 13694 and Executive Order 14144,” the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is providing and regularly updating the below lists to aid in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) adoption. The lists include hardware and software categories with example types of widely available products that use PQC standards to protect sensitive information.<a href=\"#Note1\"><sup>1</sup></a> The lists focus on categories of available products, typically acquired by the federal government, that utilize cryptographic algorithms. Because PQC-capable products are widely available in the listed categories, organizations should acquire only PQC-capable products when planning acquisitions and procuring products in these categories. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\n<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The lists below are CISA’s response to Executive Order (EO) 14306, which instructed:</p>\n<p>By December 1, 2025, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and in consultation with the Director of the National Security Agency, shall release and thereafter regularly update a list of product categories in which products that support post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are widely available.</p>\n<p>When a particular category offers widely available PQC-capable products, organizations should plan acquisitions to procure only PQC-capable products from that category.</p>\n<h3>Scope and Definitions</h3>\n<p>The scope of the lists below includes categories of hardware and software products that are—or are anticipated to be—widely available and use PQC standards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> “Widely available” describes products that are generally available in the marketplace, and agencies can acquire them in accordance with their typical procurement policies and procedures.</p>\n<p>The categories cover hardware and software products that apply PQC standards for encryption and authentication through the following cryptographic functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Key establishment:</strong><a href=\"#Note2\"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></a> A function in the lifecycle of keying material; the process by which cryptographic keys are securely established among cryptographic modules using manual transport methods (e.g., key loaders), automated methods (e.g., key-transport and/or key-agreement protocols), or a combination of automated and manual methods (consisting of key transport plus key agreement).</li>\n<li><strong>Digital signatures:</strong><a href=\"#Note3\"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a><sup> </sup>The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that, when properly implemented, provides the services of 1. origin authentication, 2. data integrity, and 3. signer non-repudiation.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key establishment is often essential for establishing confidential communication using encryption among two or more parties. Digital signatures are often essential for authenticating the parties participating in a communication and for establishing the authenticity of data, products, and services.</p>\n<p>Automated cryptographic discovery and inventory products are out of scope of these lists.</p>\n<h2><strong>Considerations for Products That Use PQC Standards</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>PQC Transition of Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure</strong></h3>\n<p>Recognizing the global need to support PQC algorithms, product manufacturers are developing new products and updating existing products to incorporate post-quantum cryptographic standards.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>National Institute of Standards and Technology</h3>\n<p>In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize one or more quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. The ongoing PQC standardization process has produced PQC standards and will likely standardize additional algorithms in the coming years.</p>\n<p>The NIST Internal Report (IR) 8547, <em>Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards</em>, describes NIST’s expected approach to transitioning from quantum-vulnerable cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum digital signature algorithms and key-establishment schemes. The report identifies existing quantum-vulnerable cryptographic standards and the current quantum-resistant standards that organizations will use in the transition. The report informs the efforts and timelines of federal agencies, industry, and standards organizations for transitioning products, services, and infrastructure to PQC. NIST will revise this report and feed into other algorithms- and application-specific guidance for the transition to PQC as necessary to support transition timelines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#Table1\">Table 1</a> shows three NIST PQC standards along with a recommendation for stateful hash-based signature algorithms that support quantum-resistant standards.<br>&nbsp;<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"Table1\"></a></p>\n<table class=\"tablesaw tablesaw-stack\" data-tablesaw-mode=\"stack\" data-tablesaw-minimap=\"\">\n<caption><em>Table 1: NIST Standard PQC Algorithms</em></caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th role=\"columnheader\" data-tablesaw-priority=\"persist\">\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Cryptographic Function</p>\n</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">\n<p class=\"text-align-center\">Algorithm Standard</p>\n</th>\n<th role=\"columnheader\">\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><strong>Standard</strong></p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Establishment</td>\n<td>Module-Lattice-Based Key- Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM)</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final\">Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 203</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Digital Signature</td>\n<td>Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA)</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final\">Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 204</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Digital Signature</td>\n<td>Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA)</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final\">Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 205</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Digital Signature</td>\n<td>Stateful Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithms: Leighton-Micali Signature Scheme (LMS), Hierarchical Merkle Signature Scheme (HMS), eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme with Multi-Tree (XMSSMT)</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/208/final\">NISTSP 800-208</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><strong>Product Lists</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"#Table2\">Table 2</a> details widely available categories with respective types of hardware and software products that use PQC standards to protect sensitive information well into the foreseeable future, including after the advent of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC).

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>For More Information</h2>\n<p>This document provides an overview of the identified vulnerability or vulnerabilities and actions required to mitigate.
