In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks from cyber threats, a comprehensive security concept must be implemented and continuously updated. Festo products and services only constitute one part of such a concept. The customer is responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Systems, machines and components should only be connected to a company's network or the Internet if and as necessary, and only when the suitable security measures (e.g., firewalls and network segmentation, defense-in-depth) are in place. Failure to ensure adequate security measures when connecting the product to the network can result in vulnerabilities which allow unauthorized, remote access to the network - even beyond the product boundaries. This access could be abused to incur a loss of data or manipulate or sabotage systems. Typical forms of attack include but are not limited to: Denial-of-Service (rendering the system temporarily non-functional), remote execution of malicious code, privilege escalation (executing malicious code with higher system privileges than expected), ransomware (encryption of data and demanding payment for decryption). In the context of industrial systems and machines this can also lead to unsafe states, posing a danger to people and equipment. Furthermore, Festo guidelines on suitable security measures should be observed. Festo products and solutions are constantly being developed further in order to make them more secure. Festo strongly recommends that customers install product updates as soon as they become available and always use the latest versions of its products. Any use of product versions that are no longer supported or any failure to install the latest updates may render the customer vulnerable to cyber-attacks.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>Festo assumes no liability whatsoever for indirect, collateral, accidental or consequential losses that occur by the distribution and/or use of this document or any losses in connection with the distribution and/or use of this document.

Given the intended usage of MES PCs for didactic purposes in controlled lab environments, separate from productive systems, it never comes into contact with sensitive information. Therefore the impact is reduced to limited availability of the system.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.</p>\n<p>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.</p>\n<p>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Advisory Conversion Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This ICSA is a verbatim republication of Festo SE &amp; Co.

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>For More Information</h2>\n<p>This document provides an overview of the identified vulnerability or vulnerabilities and actions required to mitigate.
