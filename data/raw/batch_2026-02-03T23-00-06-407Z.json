See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf\">BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet</a>&nbsp;for more information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing&nbsp;timely&nbsp;remediation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\">KEV Catalog vulnerabilities</a>&nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.
