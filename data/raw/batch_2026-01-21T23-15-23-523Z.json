Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices. For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>For More Information</h2>\n<p>This document provides an overview of the identified vulnerability or vulnerabilities and actions required to mitigate.
