Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For this reason, the PLC application code can potentially access the entire RAM memory of the CODESYS Control runtime process surrounding it. This could allow PLC programmers who have successfully authenticated themselves at the controller to execute PLC application code that can modify itself or read or write sensitive data of the CODESYS Control runtime process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4046\">View CVE Details</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Affected Products</h4>\n<h5>Schneider Electric devices using CODESYS Runtime</h5>\n<div class=\"ics-vendor-version-status\">\n<div class=\"ics-vendor\"><strong>Vendor:</strong><br>Schneider Electric</div>\n<div class=\"ics-version\"><strong>Product Version:</strong><br>Schneider Electric HMISCU Controller All versions prior to v6.3.1, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller LMC078 All Versions, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller M241 All versions prior to v5.2.11.18, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller M251 All Versions prior to v5.2.11.18, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller M262 All versions prior to v5.2.8.12, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller M258 All Versions, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller LMC058 All Versions, Schneider Electric Modicon Controller M218 All Versions, Schneider Electric PacDrive 3 Controllers: LMC Eco/Pro/Pro2 All versions prior to v1.76.14.1, Schneider Electric SoftSPS embedded in EcoStruxure Machine Expert All Versions prior to Machine Expert v2.2, Schneider Electric Vijeo Designer embedded in EcoStruxure Machine Expert All versions prior to v6.3.1, Schneider Electric Harmony (Formerly Magelis) HMIGK/HMIGTO/HMIGTU/HMIGTUX/HMISTU series All Versions prior to V6.3 HF3, Schneider Electric Easy Harmony HMIET6/HMIFT6 Magelis HMIGXU all versions prior to v2.0 HF2, Schneider Electric Magelis XBT series All Versions, Schneider Electric Easy Modicon M310 All versions prior to v3.1.5.82</div>\n<div class=\"ics-status\"><strong>Product Status:</strong><br>fixed, known_affected</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ics-remediations\">\n<h6>Remediations</h6>\n<p><strong>Vendor fix</strong><br>Version 6.3.1 of Vijeo Designer includes a fix for this vulnerability and can be updated through the Schneider Electric Software Update (SESU) application. https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-range/1054-vijeodesigner-hmi-software/#software-and-firmware On the engineering workstation, update to v6.3.1 of Vijeo Designer.

Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n<p>For further inquiries on security vulnerabilities in Siemens products and solutions, please contact the Siemens ProductCERT: https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>The use of Siemens Security Advisories is subject to the terms and conditions listed on: https://www.siemens.com/productcert/terms-of-use.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.</p>\n<p>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.</p>\n<p>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Advisory Conversion Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This ICSA is a verbatim republication of Siemens ProductCERT SSA-014678 from a direct conversion of the vendor's Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) advisory.
