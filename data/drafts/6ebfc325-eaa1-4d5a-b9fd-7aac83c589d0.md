# SamSam Ransomware

> Executive Overview: SamSam, also known as MSIL/Samas.A, represents a shift from opportunistic to highly targeted ransomware operations. Since 2016, it has focused on organizations within critical infrastructure, government, and healthcare sectors, particularly in the United States. Its manual deployment strategy distinguishes it from self-propagating worms, allowing attackers to maximize impact and demand significant ransom payments from organizations with low downtime tolerance. Threat Analysis: The threat actors utilize a multi-stage attack vector. Initially, they exploited JBoss application vulnerabilities using the JexBoss Exploit Kit, but shifted toward Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploitation. Access is gained through brute-force attacks or purchasing stolen credentials from darknet markets. Once inside, attackers perform lateral movement and privilege escalation to gain administrator rights before manually deploying the ransomware executable across all reachable hosts via the internal network. Impact Assessment: The primary impact is total operational paralysis through network-wide encryption. Because SamSam targets essential service providers, the consequences often include the cessation of public services, loss of critical patient data in healthcare, and massive remediation costs that often exceed the ransom demands. Furthermore, the presence of SamSam often indicates a broader compromise of credentials that may have been sold multiple times on the dark web. Recommendations: Organizations must secure RDP by placing it behind a VPN, enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and implementing account lockout policies to thwart brute-force attempts. Regular patching of internet-facing applications, particularly legacy JBoss installations, is vital. Maintaining offline, immutable backups and implementing comprehensive logging for RDP sessions (90-day minimum) are critical for detection and recovery.
