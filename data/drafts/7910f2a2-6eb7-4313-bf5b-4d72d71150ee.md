# DNS Infrastructure Hijacking Campaign

> Executive Overview: This intelligence report details a widespread and sophisticated global DNS infrastructure hijacking campaign that systematically undermines the integrity of the Domain Name System. By compromising administrative credentials at domain registrars and managed DNS providers, threat actors have gained the ability to manipulate authoritative resource records, facilitating large-scale traffic redirection. Threat Analysis: The campaign leverages a multi-stage execution flow. Initially, attackers obtain valid credentials through phishing or credential stuffing. Once inside the registrar's management console, they modify Address (A), Mail Exchanger (MX), and Name Server (NS) records. A critical component of this methodology involves the abuse of DNS-based validation for SSL/TLS certificates; by controlling the DNS records, attackers can generate legitimate encryption certificates for the hijacked domains. This allows for transparent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where traffic is decrypted and inspected before being forwarded to the intended destination, leaving the end-user unaware of the compromise. Impact Assessment: The impact is severe, particularly for government, telecommunications, and financial sectors. This campaign enables the interception of sensitive email communications and web traffic, leading to massive data exfiltration and credential harvesting. The use of valid certificates bypasses traditional browser security warnings, rendering standard endpoint protections ineffective against the redirection. Recommendations: Organizations must implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all accounts capable of modifying DNS records. Administrative teams should employ 'Registry Lock' services to prevent unauthorized changes at the registrar level. Furthermore, it is essential to monitor Certificate Transparency logs for unauthorized issuance and use DNSSEC to ensure the authenticity of DNS responses.
