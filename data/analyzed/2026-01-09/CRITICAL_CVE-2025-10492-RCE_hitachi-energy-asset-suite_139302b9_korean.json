For contact information, see https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us/ for Hitachi Energy contact-centers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>General Mitigation Factors</h2>\n<p>Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.</p>\n<p>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.</p>\n<p>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Advisory Conversion Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This ICSA is a verbatim republication of Hitachi Energy PSIRT 8DBD000231 from a direct conversion of the vendor's Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) advisory.

  "summary": "[Executive Overview] Hitachi Energy의 자산 관리 솔루션인 Asset Suite에서 발견된 CVE-2025-10492 취약점은 에너지 산업과 같은 주요 기반 시설(Critical Infrastructure) 운영에 치명적인 위협을 초래할 수 있는 보안 결함입니다. 이 취약점은 제품에 내장된 Jaspersoft Library의 역직렬화 메커니즘을 악용하며, 전 세계적으로 배포된 에너지 자산 관리 환경의 보안 무결성을 심각하게 훼손할 수 있습니다. [Threat Analysis] 기술적으로 이 취약점은 CWE-502(신뢰할 수 없는 데이터의 역직렬화)에 해당하며, 공격자가 인증 없이 네트워크를 통해 특수하게 조작된 데이터를 전송함으로써 대상 시스템에서 임의의 Java 코드를 실행(RCE)할 수 있게 합니다. CVSS 3.1 기준 9.8점을 기록할 만큼 공격 복잡도가 낮고 사용자 상호작용이 필요하지 않아, 자동화된 익스플로잇 도구에 의한 대규모 피해 가능성이 매우 높습니다. [Impact Assessment] 공격자가 이 결함을 성공적으로 악용할 경우, Asset Suite 시스템에 대한 완전한 제어권을 획득하여 민감한 인프라 자산 정보를 탈취하거나 운영 프로세스를 조작할 수 있습니다. 이는 에너지 그리드의 물리적 가용성 저해 및 대규모 서비스 중단으로 이어질 수 있는 고위험 시나리오를 포함합니다. [Recommendations] 대응 방안으로 Hitachi Energy는 Asset Suite 9.8 버전으로의 즉각적인 업그레이드를 강력히 권고합니다. 즉시 패치가 어려운 환경에서는 시스템 관리자가 승인한 리포트 파일만 로드되도록 제한하고, 제어 시스템 네트워크를 기업용 네트워크 및 인터넷으로부터 물리적/논리적으로 격리하는 심층 방어(Defense-in-Depth) 전략을 적용해야 합니다.",
