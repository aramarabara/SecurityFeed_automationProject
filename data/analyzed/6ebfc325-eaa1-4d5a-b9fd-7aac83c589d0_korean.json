  "content": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A. Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.</p>\n<p>The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.</p>\n<p>The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.</p>\n<p>After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.</p>\n<p>Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.</p>\n<p>SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>NCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports. The reports represent four SamSam malware variants.

System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.</li>\n<li>Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.</li>\n<li>Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Regularly apply system and software updates.</li>\n<li>Maintain a good back-up strategy.</li>\n<li>Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.</li>\n<li>When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.</li>\n<li>Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.</li>\n<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.</li>\n<li>Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.</li>\n<li>Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).</li>\n<li>Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83, <em>Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops</em>, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[<a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-83r1.pdf\" title=\"NIST SP 800-83: Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops\">1</a>]</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Contact Information</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>To report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact NCCIC, FBI, or the FBI’s Cyber Division via the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NCCIC\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov\" title=\"Report to CISA\">SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov</a></li>\n<li>1-844-Say-CISA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI’s Cyber Division\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov\">CyWatch@fbi.gov</a></li>\n<li>855-292-3937</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI through a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\" title=\"local field office\">local field office</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>\n<p>DHS strives to make this report a valuable tool for our partners and welcomes feedback on how this publication could be improved.

  "summary": "[Executive Overview] SamSam 랜섬웨어(일명 MSIL/Samas.A)는 자동화된 유포 방식 대신 공격자가 직접 네트워크에 침투하여 수동으로 실행하는 표적형 랜섬웨어 위협입니다. CISA와 FBI는 이 위협이 미국의 중요 인프라 및 정부 기관을 포함한 전 세계 조직을 대상으로 삼고 있으며, 높은 몸값을 갈취하기 위해 조직 전체를 마비시키는 전략을 사용하고 있음을 경고했습니다. [Threat Analysis] 초기 공격 방식은 JBoss 애플리케이션의 취약점(CVE-2010-0738)을 악용했으나, 점차 다크넷에서 구매한 RDP(원격 데스크톱 프로토콜) 자격 증명을 이용하거나 무차별 대입 공격을 수행하는 방식으로 진화했습니다. 침투 성공 시 공격자는 수동으로 권한 상승을 시도하고 네트워크 내부에서 측면 이동(Lateral Movement)을 수행하며, 가시성이 높은 도구를 사용하여 모든 연결된 호스트에 랜섬웨어를 배포합니다. [Impact Assessment] SamSam은 개별 시스템보다는 조직의 핵심 서버를 겨냥하여 서비스 중단을 극대화합니다. 이는 의료 시스템, 공공 서비스 등 필수 기능을 수행하는 조직에 치명적인 운영 중단을 초래하며, 복구의 시급성을 악용하여 대규모 비트코인 몸값 지불을 강요합니다. 실제로 여러 피해 조직은 랜섬웨어 감염 외에도 다른 침입 흔적을 발견하여 2차 피해의 위험성을 시사했습니다. [Recommendations] 대응을 위해서는 외부로 노출된 RDP 포트(3389)를 차단하거나 VPN 뒤로 배치하고, 다요소 인증(MFA)을 필수적으로 도입해야 합니다. 또한 정기적인 오프라인 백업 관리, JBoss 및 관련 서버의 최신 보안 패치 적용, 최소 90일 이상의 RDP 로그 보관 및 상시 모니터링이 권장됩니다.",
