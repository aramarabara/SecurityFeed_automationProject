  "content": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A. Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.</p>\n<p>The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.</p>\n<p>The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.</p>\n<p>After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.</p>\n<p>Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.</p>\n<p>SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>NCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports.

System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.</li>\n<li>Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.</li>\n<li>Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Regularly apply system and software updates.</li>\n<li>Maintain a good back-up strategy.</li>\n<li>Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.</li>\n<li>When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.</li>\n<li>Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.</li>\n<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.</li>\n<li>Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.</li>\n<li>Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).</li>\n<li>Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83, <em>Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops</em>, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[<a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-83r1.pdf\" title=\"NIST SP 800-83: Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops\">1</a>]</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Contact Information</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>To report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact NCCIC, FBI, or the FBI’s Cyber Division via the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NCCIC\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov\" title=\"Report to CISA\">SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov</a></li>\n<li>1-844-Say-CISA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI’s Cyber Division\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov\">CyWatch@fbi.gov</a></li>\n<li>855-292-3937</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI through a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\" title=\"local field office\">local field office</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>\n<p>DHS strives to make this report a valuable tool for our partners and welcomes feedback on how this publication could be improved.

  "summary": "[Executive Overview] SamSam 랜섬웨어(MSIL/Samas.A)는 2016년부터 미국 내 주요 기반 시설, 의료 및 교육 기관을 집중적으로 겨냥해 온 고도화된 표적형 위협입니다. 불특정 다수를 대상으로 하는 일반적인 랜섬웨어와 달리, SamSam 공격자는 특정 조직을 정밀 타격하여 네트워크 전체를 마비시키고 고액의 몸값을 요구하는 전략을 구사합니다. [Threat Analysis] 초기 공격 방식은 JBoss 애플리케이션의 취약점을 악용하는 JexBoss Exploit Kit에 의존했으나, 점차 원격 데스크톱 프로토콜(RDP)을 통한 침투로 진화했습니다. 공격자들은 다크웹에서 탈취된 RDP 자격 증명을 구매하거나 무차별 대입 공격(Brute Force)을 통해 초기 접근 권한을 획득합니다. 침투 후에는 권한 상승을 통해 관리자 권한을 확보하고, 탐지를 피해 네트워크 내 연결된 모든 호스트에 랜섬웨어를 수동으로 배포 및 실행합니다. [Impact Assessment] SamSam은 개별 PC가 아닌 조직 전체의 서버와 워크스테이션을 동시에 암호화하여 비즈니스 연속성에 치명적인 타격을 입힙니다. 특히 가용성이 필수적인 공공 서비스 기관의 경우, 운영 중단으로 인한 피해를 최소화하기 위해 공격자의 요구에 굴복할 가능성이 높으며, 이는 수만 달러에 달하는 비트코인 지불과 심각한 데이터 유출 사고로 이어집니다. [Recommendations] 최우선적으로 RDP 포트(3389)의 외부 노출을 차단하고 VPN 및 다요소 인증(MFA)을 필수 적용해야 합니다. 또한 강력한 계정 잠금 정책을 시행하여 무차별 대입 공격을 방어하고, JBoss와 같은 외부 노출 서버의 정기적인 보안 패치 업데이트 및 오프라인 백업 전략을 수립하여 감염 시 즉각적인 복구 역량을 갖춰야 합니다.",
