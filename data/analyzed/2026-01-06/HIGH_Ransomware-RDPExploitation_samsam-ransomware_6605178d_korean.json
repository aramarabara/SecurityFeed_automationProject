  "content": "<div>\n<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are issuing this activity alert to inform computer network defenders about SamSam ransomware, also known as MSIL/Samas.A. Specifically, this product shares analysis of vulnerabilities that cyber actors exploited to deploy this ransomware. In addition, this report provides recommendations for prevention and mitigation.</p>\n<p>The SamSam actors targeted multiple industries, including some within critical infrastructure. Victims were located predominately in the United States, but also internationally. Network-wide infections against organizations are far more likely to garner large ransom payments than infections of individual systems. Organizations that provide essential functions have a critical need to resume operations quickly and are more likely to pay larger ransoms.</p>\n<p>The actors exploit Windows servers to gain persistent access to a victim’s network and infect all reachable hosts. According to reporting from victims in early 2016, cyber actors used the JexBoss Exploit Kit to access vulnerable JBoss applications. Since mid-2016, FBI analysis of victims’ machines indicates that cyber actors use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain persistent access to victims’ networks. Typically, actors either use brute force attacks or stolen login credentials. Detecting RDP intrusions can be challenging because the malware enters through an approved access point.</p>\n<p>After gaining access to a particular network, the SamSam actors escalate privileges for administrator rights, drop malware onto the server, and run an executable file, all without victims’ action or authorization. While many ransomware campaigns rely on a victim completing an action, such as opening an email or visiting a compromised website, RDP allows cyber actors to infect victims with minimal detection.</p>\n<p>Analysis of tools found on victims’ networks indicated that successful cyber actors purchased several of the stolen RDP credentials from known darknet marketplaces. FBI analysis of victims’ access logs revealed that the SamSam actors can infect a network within hours of purchasing the credentials. While remediating infected systems, several victims found suspicious activity on their networks unrelated to SamSam. This activity is a possible indicator that the victims’ credentials were stolen, sold on the darknet, and used for other illegal activity.</p>\n<p>SamSam actors leave ransom notes on encrypted computers. These instructions direct victims to establish contact through a Tor hidden service site. After paying the ransom in Bitcoin and establishing contact, victims usually receive links to download cryptographic keys and tools to decrypt their network.</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>NCCIC recommends organizations review the following SamSam Malware Analysis Reports. The reports represent four SamSam malware variants.

System owners and administrators should review any configuration changes before implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audit your network for systems that use RDP for remote communication. Disable the service if unneeded or install available patches. Users may need to work with their technology venders to confirm that patches will not affect system processes.</li>\n<li>Verify that all cloud-based virtual machine instances with public IPs have no open RDP ports, especially port 3389, unless there is a valid business reason to keep open RDP ports. Place any system with an open RDP port behind a firewall and require users to use a virtual private network (VPN) to access that system.</li>\n<li>Enable strong passwords and account lockout policies to defend against brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Where possible, apply two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Regularly apply system and software updates.</li>\n<li>Maintain a good back-up strategy.</li>\n<li>Enable logging and ensure that logging mechanisms capture RDP logins. Keep logs for a minimum of 90 days and review them regularly to detect intrusion attempts.</li>\n<li>When creating cloud-based virtual machines, adhere to the cloud provider’s best practices for remote access.</li>\n<li>Ensure that third parties that require RDP access follow internal policies on remote access.</li>\n<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Where possible, disable RDP on critical devices.</li>\n<li>Regulate and limit external-to-internal RDP connections. When external access to internal resources is required, use secure methods such as VPNs. Of course, VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.</li>\n<li>Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).</li>\n<li>Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in Special Publication 800-83, <em>Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops</em>, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.[<a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-83r1.pdf\" title=\"NIST SP 800-83: Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops\">1</a>]</p>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Contact Information</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<p>To report an intrusion and request resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact NCCIC, FBI, or the FBI’s Cyber Division via the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NCCIC\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov\" title=\"Report to CISA\">SayCISA@cisa.dhs.gov</a></li>\n<li>1-844-Say-CISA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI’s Cyber Division\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov\">CyWatch@fbi.gov</a></li>\n<li>855-292-3937</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>FBI through a <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\" title=\"local field office\">local field office</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>\n<p>DHS strives to make this report a valuable tool for our partners and welcomes feedback on how this publication could be improved.

  "summary": "[Executive Overview] SamSam(MSIL/Samas.A) 랜섬웨어는 특정 조직을 정밀 타격하는 '표적형 공격'의 전형으로, 일반적인 피싱 메일 배포 방식과 달리 공격자가 직접 네트워크에 침투하여 수동으로 악성코드를 실행하는 특징을 가집니다. 미국 국토안보부(DHS)와 FBI는 이 위협이 국가 핵심 인프라를 포함한 광범위한 산업 분야에 심각한 피해를 입히고 있음을 경고하며, 특히 운영 중단 시 막대한 지장을 초래하는 조직들을 주요 타겟으로 삼고 있습니다.[Threat Analysis] 초기에는 JexBoss 익스플로잇 키트를 이용해 취약한 JBoss 애플리케이션(CVE-2010-0738 등)을 공격했으나, 최근에는 다크웹에서 구매한 도난 계정이나 브루트포스(Brute-force)를 통한 RDP(원격 데스크톱 프로토콜) 침투가 주된 경로로 확인되었습니다. 침투 후 공격자는 관리자 권한을 탈취(Privilege Escalation)하고 수동으로 랜섬웨어를 실행하며, 이는 사용자의 클릭 없이도 네트워크 전체를 감염시킬 수 있어 탐지가 매우 어렵습니다.[Impact Assessment] 이 공격은 단일 시스템이 아닌 조직 전체의 가용성을 마비시킴으로써 의료, 정부 기관 등 필수 서비스를 제공하는 인프라에 치명적인 타격을 줍니다. 피해 조직은 서비스 재개를 위해 거액의 비트코인 몸값을 지불해야 하는 경제적 손실뿐만 아니라, 도난당한 자격 증명이 다크웹에 유통되어 발생하는 2차 침해 사고의 위험에도 직면하게 됩니다.[Recommendations] 조직은 외부로 노출된 RDP 포트(TCP 3389)를 즉시 점검하고 필요하지 않은 경우 비활성화해야 하며, 접근이 필요한 경우 반드시 VPN 및 다요소 인증(MFA)을 적용해야 합니다. 또한, 웹 애플리케이션 취약점 패치, 최소 90일 이상의 RDP 로그 보관 및 정기적인 모니터링, 오프라인 기반의 데이터 백업 전략 수립이 필수적인 방어 조치로 권고됩니다.",
