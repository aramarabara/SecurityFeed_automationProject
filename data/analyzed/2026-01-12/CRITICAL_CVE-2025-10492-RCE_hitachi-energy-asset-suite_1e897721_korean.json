For contact information, see https://www.hitachienergy.com/contact-us/ for Hitachi Energy contact-centers.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>General Mitigation Factors</h2>\n<p>Recommended security practices and firewall configurations can help protect a process control network from attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices include that process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel, have no direct connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed, and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system. Proper password policies and processes should be followed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Legal Notice and Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>This product is provided subject to this Notification (https://www.cisa.gov/notification) and this Privacy &amp; Use policy (https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy).</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Recommended Practices</h2>\n<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the internet.</p>\n<p>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.</p>\n<p>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most recent version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.</p>\n<p>CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</p>\n<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>\n<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Advisory Conversion Disclaimer</h2>\n<p>This ICSA is a verbatim republication of Hitachi Energy PSIRT 8DBD000231 from a direct conversion of the vendor's Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) advisory.

  "summary": "[Executive Overview] Hitachi Energy의 자산 관리 솔루션인 Asset Suite에서 원격 코드 실행(RCE)이 가능한 심각한 보안 취약점(CVE-2025-10492)이 발견되었습니다. 이 취약점은 전 세계 에너지 산업의 핵심 인프라를 관리하는 시스템에 영향을 미치며, 공격자가 시스템을 완전히 장악할 수 있는 높은 위험성을 내포하고 있습니다. [Threat Analysis] 해당 위협은 Jaspersoft Library라는 서드파티 구성 요소의 Java 역직렬화 취약점(CWE-502)에서 기인합니다. 공격자는 특수하게 제작된 직렬화 데이터를 전송함으로써 인증 없이도 네트워크를 통해 대상 시스템에서 임의의 코드를 실행할 수 있습니다. 특히 이 과정에서 사용자 상호작용이나 높은 권한이 필요하지 않아 공격 난이도가 낮고 파급력은 매우 큽니다. [Impact Assessment] Asset Suite는 에너지 부문의 핵심 설비 관리를 담당하므로, 취약점 악용 시 전력망 운영 중단, 자산 정보 유출, 또는 OT(운영 기술) 네트워크 내에서의 측면 이동(Lateral Movement)으로 이어질 수 있습니다. 이는 단순한 데이터 손실을 넘어 국가적 핵심 서비스의 물리적 안정성을 저해할 수 있는 중대한 위협입니다. [Recommendations] 영향받는 버전(9.7 이하)을 사용하는 조직은 즉시 9.8 버전으로 업데이트할 것을 권고합니다. 패치 적용 전까지는 시스템 관리자가 생성한 신뢰할 수 있는 보고서만 로드하도록 제한하고, 제어 시스템 네트워크를 인터넷으로부터 물리적으로 분리하며 VPN과 같은 보안 연결을 강화하는 방어 전략을 수립해야 합니다.",
